The game.tra files in these subdirectories are UTF8 encoded, for EE
games.

Main differences:
  No usability information in item descriptions.
  Kit descriptions match the EE format (at least for English).
  Separate descriptions for kit abilities

They should contain no redundant strings (strings that differ only in
encoding), apart from non-English kit descriptions.
